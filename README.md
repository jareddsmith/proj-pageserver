A "getting started" project for CIS 322, software engineering 1 at University of Oregon.

### Assignment ###
  * The pageserver now serves web pages (text files with names that end with .html) and style sheets (text files that end with .css) from the directory in which the server is run.
	It rejects URLs with unauthorized characters and returns the error on the client. Files not found in the directory will produce a 404 error on the client as well, if the file type is accepted.
  *  Tested and running pageserver on ix.cs.uoregon.edu (1/8/2016 ~16:00)
